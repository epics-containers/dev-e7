View generated HTML
===================

We don't have a browser installed in the devcontainer, so it can be less
convenient to view the generated HTML.

Rather than installing a browser inside the devcontainer you
can use the
[provided vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peakchen90.open-html-in-browser).

Simply right-click on the html file in the explorer and choose
"Open in default browser"
