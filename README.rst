A developer container based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

This container provides a complete, portable and customizable development
environment for EPICS and Python projects. Use this container to develop
work on:

- EPICS Containers: Generic IOCs and Support Modules
- Python Soft IOCs
- Other Python Projects

This project has two companion repositories:

- `.devcontainer  <https://github.com/epics-containers/.devcontainer>`_
  makes it easy to set up a customizable VSCode workspace based upon this
  container.

- `python3-pip-skeleton <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/python3-pip-skeleton-cli>`_
  provides a skeleton for python projects that is recommended,
  but not required for use within this container.
