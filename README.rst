A developer container based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

This container provides a development environment for working on:

- EPICS Containers Generic IOCs
- EPICS Support Modules
- Python Soft IOCs
- Other Python Projects

This container works well with VSCode and the the developer-customizable
devcontainer project.

See https://github.com/epics-containers/.devcontainer

This container also works well with python projects based on
python3-pip-skeleton, but other python projects should work as well.

See https://diamondlightsource.github.io/python3-pip-skeleton-cli
